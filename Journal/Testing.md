# Test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1
Demonstration of lights and testing setup mode, as well as building the basic functions into the micro:bit.
This was a semi-seccess as the code needed finetuning.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2
Refining setup mode by fixing button inputs as well as adding a visual display and testing the alarm once the timer reaches zero.
This was a semi-seccess and needed finetuning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3
Created the fundimentals and back bones code for the clock, making sure the lights on it's face worked according to plan (they did not at first, so we refined it)
