# Test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1
Demonstration of lights and testing setup mode, as well as building the basic functions into the micro:bit.
This was a semi-seccess as the code needed finetuning.
Reasoning listed below
> The buttons were inactive, and the display did not display the right binary.

> In some situations the code wouldn't even start.

Test 1.2
This was a slight improvements, the bianry wouldn't run correctly. The code did start completley, but the clock system had difficulty keeping track of the time.
I wished that there was a live clock system that could be imported onto the microbit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2
Refining setup mode by fixing button inputs as well as adding a visual display and testing the alarm once the timer reaches zero.
This was a semi-seccess and needed finetuning
I started inputing the OOP the system did not work at first, I was forced to revisist the OOP lessons for further information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3
Created the fundimentals and back bones code for the clock, making sure the lights on it's face worked according to plan (they did not at first, so we refined it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4
Added seconds to the clock that would give a more accurate time as well as refining the unstable/broken codes
