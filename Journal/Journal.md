Acheivments
I have added 2 imports including:
    microbit
    time
This will help me adding clock function and detecting what time it is when adding an alarm system.

Problems
I have one problem though so far, this including:
    Local time - from the import 'time'
I do not know how to fic this as it is a browser based code editor.

Goals
> Get clock function working
> Get Alarm system working
    Set Alarm
    Make Noise when alarm is timed
